# Guass Rank Scaler
  
A scikit-learn style transformer that scales numeric variables to normal distributions. 

Input normalization for neural networks is very important. GaussRank is an effective algorithm for converting numeric variable distributions to normals. It is based on rank transformation.

First step is to assign a linspace to the sorted features from -1, …, 1, then apply the inverse of error function ErfInv to shape them like gaussians, then I substract the mean. Binary features are not touched with this trafo (eg. 1-hot ones). This works usually much better than standard mean/std scaler or min/max.
